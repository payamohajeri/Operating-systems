Write a program that creates 10 threads. Have each thread execute the same function and pass each thread a unique number.
Each thread should print "Hello, World (thread n)" five times where 'n' is replaced by the thread's number.
Use an array of pthread_t objects to hold the various thread IDs. Be sure the program doesn't terminate until all the threads are complete.
Try running your program on more than one machine. Are there any differences in how it behaves?
